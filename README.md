# Hypseus Singe

Hypseus is a fork of [Matt Ownby's][CUS] [Daphne].

A program to play laserdisc arcade games on a PC, Mac or Raspberry Pi.

This version includes **Singe** support for Fan Made and [American Laser Games][ALG].

Features:

* SDL2 support
* Updated MPEG2 decoder
* Daphne VLDP 32bit upgrade
* Integrated _(active)_ [bezel](screenshots/bezel.png?raw=true) support
* Daphne and Singe 4k 4Gb+ M2V support
* Singe full 32bit overlay support (details below)
* Multiple *GameController* (*hotplug*) support: [config](doc/hypinput_gamepad.ini)
* Joystick, GamePad, Lightgun _EV_ABS_ [mouse] support
* Advanced configuration and multi-joystick support: [config](doc/hypinput.ini)
* 'lair/ace' [hardware](https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypseus_scoreboard) and [software](screenshots/scoreboard.png?raw=true) original scoreboards.
* 64bit Windows and MacOS X Ports

## Windows

**Windows** files and documentation can be found [here](win32/)

## Compile

Minimum software requirements: [gcc], [cmake], [autotools], [zlib], [SDL2],
[libtool], [libzip], [vorbis] and [ogg].

### MacOS X

Use homebrew to install the following packages:

    brew install cmake
    brew install autoconf
    brew install automake
    brew install pkg-config
    brew install sdl2
    brew install sdl2_ttf
    brew install sdl2_image
    brew install sdl2_mixer
    brew install libtool
    brew install libvorbis
    brew install libogg
    brew install libzip

Newer series Macs may need to use the _brew_ `libmpeg2` package:

    brew install libmpeg2

Then clone the `libmpeg2` branch:

    git clone --single-branch --branch libmpeg2 https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypseus-singe.git

### Raspberry Pi

For **Raspberry Pi** clone the ``RetroPie`` branch via:

    git clone --single-branch --branch RetroPie https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypseus-singe.git

Further **RetroPie** and **Raspberry Pi** information can be found [here](doc/RETROPIE.md)

### Compilation with CMake

Build:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../src
    make

## Install and Run

Ensure you have data in the following `hypseus` HOME folders:

    pics, fonts, ram, roms, midi, sound, singe, vldp

Run `hypseus` with `daphne` style [arguments](doc/CmdLine.md) on the command line:

    hypseus lair vldp -framefile vldp/lair/lair.txt -scorebezel

    hypseus singe vldp -framefile singe/timegal/timegal.txt -zlua roms/timegal.zip


In **Windows**, create `.bat`, or `.vbs`, scripts with arguments for specific games.

Example `.bat` files  are provided within the [Windows](win32/) zip file.

**Retro gaming** systems will require adoption within the relevant emulation scripts.

The singe `-retropath` argument can ease integration into EmulationStation style systems.  
Although this is now discouraged in favor of the _Zipped LUA_ (`zlua`) packages.

`bash` scripts are provided for systems that support this shell.

**Build Hypseus home and install bash scripts:**

    mkdir -p ~/.hypseus/roms ~/.hypseus/vldp ~/.hypseus/singe
    cp -R pics sound fonts midi ~/.hypseus
    
    sudo cp build/hypseus /usr/local/bin/hypseus.bin
    sudo cp scripts/run.sh /usr/local/bin/hypseus
    sudo cp scripts/singe.sh /usr/local/bin/singe

## Input Configurations

Configuration of button keycodes and joysticks should be made within [hypinput.ini](doc/hypinput.ini)

By default SDL2 Keycodes and the Joystick API configuration options will be used.

Use the [hypjsch](https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypjsch) utilities to help with advanced scancode configurations.

Refer to [keylist.txt](doc/keylist.txt) for **SDL2** keycode values.

SDL GameController API configuration can now be enabled for supported controllers.

Enable **SDL_GameController** using `-gamepad`. Example config: [hypinput_gamepad.ini](doc/hypinput_gamepad.ini)

Update the Controllers _db_ by placing `gamecontrollerdb.txt` in the Hypseus home folder.

## Game Configuration arguments

Refer to [CmdLine.md](doc/CmdLine.md) for the full argument list.

## Altering Hypseus or Singe ROM locations in bash scripts

Edit **run.sh** and **singe.sh**, to reflect the location of your ROM folders:

    HYPSEUS_SHARE=~/.hypseus

## Bezels

Bezel arguments are documented in: [Bezels.md](doc/Bezels.md)

## Hardware USB Scoreboard

Example arguments: `-usbscoreboard COM 4 9600`

Full details of the USB scoreboard [here](https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypseus_scoreboard).

## Software Scoreboard

Enable the software external [scoreboard panel](screenshots/scoreboard.png?raw=true) in lair/ace: `-scorepanel`.  
Use `KEY_TILT` to switch displays when using multiple screens.

A *bezel* based alternate is also available via: `-scorebezel`

The scorepanel, or bezel, can be positioned using `-scorepanel_position x y` - *Window Managers* may influence placement of the panel, *scorebezel* is not under their influence. The `-scorebezel_alpha` argument is a transparency option for the bezel based scoreboard.

## Singe

For Singe, provide the following arguments to *hypseus*:

    hypseus singe vldp -framefile ~/.hypseus/singe/timegal/timegal.txt -zlua ~/.hypseus/roms/timegal.zip -homedir ~/.hypseus/ -datadir ~/.hypseus/

Check for Singe LUA game files [here](https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypseus_singe_data).

## Singe 2

Hypseus Singe has support for Singe 2 games, including full 32bit overlays.

For current details see: [Hypseus Singe Data](https://github.com/DirtBagXon/hypseus_singe_data)

## Lightguns

Singe supports Sinden and DolphinBar based lightguns with the `-manymouse` argument.

This argument enables *absolute* (``EV_ABS``) mouse input event codes.

**Note:** `-sinden` automatically enables `-manymouse`

## Singe joystick [mouse] support

Singe automatically interprets **joystick axis** change, on joystick _#0_, as basic digital mouse input.

Adjust sensitivity via `-js_range <1-20>` in game arguments, or disable with `-nojoymouse`

#### Game Controllers

`-gamepad -manymouse` will enable multiple mouse inputs via multiple Game Controller analog inputs.

Please submit [issues] or [pull requests] directly to the [project].

## About

Open development of Daphne, by [Matt Ownby][CUS], ceased several years ago.

Singe LUA games were originally a plugin to Daphne, created by [Scott Duensing][SD].

This repository builds upon the Hypseus project initiated by [Jeffrey Clark][JAC].  
It marked the beginning of the transition to _SDL2_ for Daphne, but excluded Singe.

The name of this application, refers to a _[sibling of Daphne][peneus]_ in Greek mythology.

Thanks go out to [Matt Ownby][CUS], [Scott Duensing][SD], [Jeffrey Clark][JAC],
[Manuel Alfayate][MAC], [David Griffith][DG] and the many other developers
who made their work available for me to build upon. Without them this
project would not be possible.
