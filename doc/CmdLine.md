|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| -altaudio \<suffix string>       | Specifies a suffix to be added to the audio filenames that Hypseus would normally try to use. The purpose is so you can use alternate audio for games. |
| -alwaysontop                     | Enable SDL WINDOW_ALWAYS_ON_TOP for main game window. |
| -bank \<which bank> \<base2 value> | Used to modify dip switch settings. The 'which bank' argument specifies which dip switch bank to modify, where 0 is the first bank. The 'base2 value' argument is in 8-bit binary form that is composed of 1's and 0's, where the right-most bit corresponds to the first dip switch. For example, if you wanted to enable dip switch 0 in bank 0, but disable switches 1-7, then you'd do "-bank 0 00000001". |
| -bezel \<bezel.png>              | Specify a png bezel in 'bezels' sub-folder             |

| -prefer_samples                  | Same games can emulate sound or use samples of sounds. If both emulated and sampled sounds are available, this option will force sampled sounds to be used. Otherwise, emulated sounds will always be used. |
| -preset \<number>                | A simple way to pass arguments directly to the game driver. Tells the game driver to use a specific preset configuration. Different for each game. |
| -ramdir \<path>                  | Sets an alternate `ram` directory path.          |

| -vertical_stretch \<value>        | Vertically stretches the screen outward from the center. The purpose of this is to remove the black bars on the top and bottom of Cliff Hanger and Goal to Go. To get rid of the black bars completely, use a value of 24. |
